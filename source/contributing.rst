Contributing
=============

If you wish to contribute to pomf you can look at the issue tracker for current bugs or
you can join #pomfret on irc.rizon.net.

All pomf projects use `Airbnb <https://github.com/airbnb/javascript>`_ style guide for Javascript,
`Airbnb <https://github.com/airbnb/css>`_ for CSS and `PSR-2 <www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/>`_ for php.

We expect 2 spaces for all CSS and JS and 4 for all PHP code

These styles will be enforced in pull requests. All pull requests must also pass with
travis-ci before being merged in.
